Tips:

	- Save by going to "Developer" --> "Export" and saving as the same name.
	- Crashes are most often caused by acessing the wrong part of an array.
	- Crashes can sometimes be solved by pulling the chord on the sensor.
	- Crashes can always be solved by pulling the battery on the EV3 Brick.
	
	Setting up XML:
		- You have two blocks.xml files: one is in the root, one is under strings.  
	
	You can't initiate an array except with a constant.  Arrays cant be resized.
	An example of sending multi-dimension arrays: dLight.
	An example of reading multi-dimension arrays: dGPS.
	
	I2C Communication:
		- First byte is the address.  The EV3 shifts this out with an extra 0.  (xE0 becomes x70)
	
	BEWARE THE TYPE CONVERSIONS.  
	
	To incorporate some changes:  
		- zip up folder "Dexter" and run the .bat file (renames it Dexter.ev3b)
		- Tools, Block Import and select Dexter.ev3b
		- Restart.
